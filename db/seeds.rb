               In a mixing bowl, combine the nutella, eggs and flour together until mixed thoroughly. 
               Transfer mixture to a medium snap lock bag and cut the corner tip cut off. Pipe the mixture into the donut pans until each is approximately 2/3 full. 
               If using a donut pan, bake in the oven for around 10 minutes until they spring back when pressed. If using a mini donut maker, bake for 2-3 minutes.
               Allow donuts to cool completely before icing with extra nutella."}
